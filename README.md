### Hiya ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Brazilian Compsci undergraduate at UFFS. Bit of a gamedev wannabe, but looking forward to other experiences as well. Feel free to hit me up if you are looking for someone to team up with for a project!

ðŸŒ± Languages and tools I have some or substantial experience with:
- C#/Unity;
- C99;
- Python;
- Java;
- Bash;

ðŸ”­ Currently working on a chess variant using Unity, whose source code will be available as soon as I have the basic mechanics sorted out.
