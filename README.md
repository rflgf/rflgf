### Hiya 👋

I'm a Brazilian Compsci undergraduate at UFFS. Bit of a gamedev wannabe, but looking forward to other experiences as well. Feel free to hit me up if you are looking for someone to team up with for a project!

🌱 Languages and tools I have some or substantial experience with:
- C++;
- C#/Unity;
- Python;
- Java;
- Bash;

🔭 Currently working on a chess variant using SDL2, whose source code will be available as soon as I have the basic engine and mechanics sorted out.
